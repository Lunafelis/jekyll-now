### CREATE A PASSION OF LEARNING

##### (this is my first blog. hope you like it)

The most important reason for "learning with passion" is always more effective than normal learning is not because of motivating that put them to learn harder but because they will naturally know how to learn the most effective and time-saving way.
 Instead of starting with a broad and basic learning like traditional way, enthusiasts usually start with the outcome - the result that they wants to achieve after they finish.
 They will then be able to identify a more rational pathway and ignore unnecessary cumbersome and unnecessary knowledge. 
 
 The person standing at the finish line always see the road race more clearly.
