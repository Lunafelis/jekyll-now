### WHY DO PRAYERS RARELY WORKS?

##### (this is my first blog. hope you like it)



I have once dreamed of a god, and this is my conversation with him:

Me: Mighty God, can this mortal be enlightened?

Spirit: Sure you can ask.

Me: Mighty God, can you hear all the prayers of the people?

Spirit: Of course i can.

Me: Then , this mortal wants to ask, why do prayers rarely works ? Aren’t you love your people?

Spirit: Oh, I do love my people. But now I ask you this, have you ever heard of the "butterfly effect"?

Me: I have not.

Spirit: I think so too. The butterfly effect explains that a small butterfly's wing flap can cause slight variations in the physics root conditions, resulting in significant changes in the weather. like a whirlwind at a place thousands of miles away from the butterfly. It says that every event in the world is commected together so closely that just a small change can be the premise for a great event, like the way the dominoes pours into the other, resulting in a series of pours. Same with human prayers. When you pray, you do not think beyond what it costs. Have you ever tried to think if your prayers was accepted , it could cause bad things for an another person or cause a bad accident? Do not think you can calculate it. Because the parameters to calculate is very large. Even the gods will got a headache by that. So the prayers i hear from people, if they are accepted, most will affect someone else. If you pray that you will live on the battlefield, it means that other innocent warriors on the other side of the battle line will die for your life. If you pray to be rich, do you think that it will be in return that someone will lose their job because of you took it? See, i can not arbitrarily answer the prayers, because accept this person’s prayer will hurt others. Of course, sometimes there are prayers that do not affect anything, but those prayers are often not to pray for their own benefit. With such prayers, i will smile.

So, go and teach your children, instead of praying for a god, you are better of making your own wishes come true. By then, i will not need to intervene at all. Do you understand?

Me: This mortal feels enlightened. Thank you.

Of course the story is just my fiction. I do not refer to any religion at all. Because almost every religion has prayers. But what I think is basically written.
