### IF I HAD A RIVAL, I'LL LEARN HOW TO LIKE HIM
Because if he falls in love with me, she would not have a chance ... just kidding!

Most people, when faced with emotional problems, will become mentaly. In this case, people tend to either look at themselves (what is wrong with me that makes she like him more than i? , am i not good?) or the rival( Is he better than me? ....)
But the actual person that needs attention here is not care about is: your girlfriend. 
The right question is: Why does she like him?

Who do you love? Do you love yourself or love your rival? NO. You love your girlfriend. So if she shows you that she likes someone else, then that's her business.
It is very unfortunate for girls who have been accidentally labeled as "pragmatic" or "henchman" by their lover even when the attraction from another guy may not be money or his beauty but something more valuable like a sense of safe or desire for care. 
Look, if she is "pragmatic" or "sharp" then why she choose YOU from the beginning?!

So if one day I feel my lover likes another, what I do will be to put myself in her thought, to see clearly what she likes about the other person, even if the factors Isn't completely unreasonable (again, anyone can be mentally).
 In other words, learn to "like" your rival. That would probably challenge your ego, but I'm sure ego is something to put under the heels of the shoe when dealing with conflict.


In life there are things are not related to emotions but you have to put emotions into it for solving, but things directly related to emotions are not to put emotions. Because if then objectivity in your thought will disappear.
